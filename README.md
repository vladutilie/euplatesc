## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

This package is the result of my passion and openness to open-source software. Also many times I had to implement this service in my projects and almost every time I had to deal with a headache due to the poor documentation and the non-standard "REST API" provided by EuPlătesc.

This package covers all the actions provided in the EuPlătesc documentation.
